### Global Internet Usage and Search Engine Analysis

This project explores the evolving landscape of internet usage worldwide, focusing on the distribution of users across different search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo! in the top 12 countries by internet user population. Utilizing RStudio for data filtering, importing, and merging, followed by Tableau for dynamic visualizations, the project aims to provide a comprehensive view of global internet engagement trends.

### Project Overview:
Objective: To analyze internet usage patterns by users across the top search engines in the world's most populous internet user countries.
Data Sources: Compiled datasets included the list of countries by the number of internet users and desktop search engine market share from December 2011 to December 2021.
Analysis Focus:
Determining the ranking of countries based on the volume of users utilizing search engines via desktop.
Calculating the total number of users for each search engine, including Google, Bing, Yahoo!, etc.
Key Insights:
Country Selection: The analysis was centered on the top 12 countries, not by internet penetration rates but by the sheer number of internet users, providing insights into global digital landscapes.
Search Engine Criteria: Search engines with a user percentage greater than 1% were included to focus on significant market players.
Visualizations: Leveraged Tableau to create engaging visual representations, including:
A map highlighting internet usage intensity across selected countries.
Pie charts depicting the distribution of internet users by country.
Comparative analyses of search engine preferences across different regions.

### Conclusions:
The project delivered a nuanced understanding of how and where the world accesses information online, emphasizing the dominance of major search engines and the geographical distribution of internet users. It underscored the growing importance of digital accessibility and the competitive landscape of search engines in shaping internet consumption patterns.

By merging complex datasets and employing Tableau for visualization alongside analytical processes in R, this project not only sheds light on current internet usage trends but also offers a basis for predicting future shifts in digital engagement globally.
